import numpy as np

import tensorflow as tf

from tensorflow.keras. layers import Dense from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

Define the input vector

input vector = np.array ([- 1, 1, 1, 1])

# Create a simple autoassociative network

model = Sequential ([ Dense (2, activation relu, input_shape= ( 4 ,)) Dense ( 4 , activation="linear"}}}

#Compile the model

model.compile(optimizer='adam, loss="mean_squared error")

Train the model to Learn the identity function

model.fit(np.array([input_vector]), np.array([input_vector]), epochs=1000)

#Test the network with the original input

output model.predict(np.array([input_vector])) print("Original Input:", Input vector)

print("Output of Autoassociative Network:", output)

*** Now, let's test the trained autoassociative network with various scenarios:

One Missing Entry:

Remove one element from the input vector and feed it to the network. For example, test it with [- 1, 1, 1] .

One Wrong Entry:

Change one element in the input vector and feed it to the network. For example, test it with [- 1, - 1, - 1, - 1, - 1, - 1] ]

Two Wrong Entries:

Change two elements in the input vector and feed it to the network. For example, test it with \{1, - 1, - 1, - 1\}

Two Missing Entries:

Remove two elements from the input vector and feed it to the network. For example, test it with [- 1, 1] .
